                <p id="rest">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a “good” student in China, you don’t need to, and probably are not supposed to, have a lot of emotions. Anxiety seemed to be the only emotion hanging on every 9th-grade student’s mind that day. It was the day of the High School Entrance Examination, the standardized testing that may forever change one’s life, in my city. Everybody was competing for the few spots into the best schools, and for them, this was the only chance. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Luckily, I wasn’t one of them. If there’s one thing that nine years of being a student had taught me, it was that I’m not an excellent test taker. Therefore, my parents and I decided to study abroad in the US, where my future is not necessarily determined by one test. So where was I that day? I just stayed up late until 3 AM studying for a Spanish test the following day. “So, torture has never stopped. Right, Charlie?” 
                    <br>

                    That was my only impression of what being a Webb student is all about during my freshman year. After spending a year in an entirely new environment, I was exhausted. I wasn’t so happy about how I spent my first year at Webb, and I didn’t have any plans for the summer. But for my development as a person, the year was worth it. Unlike all my friends back in China, who’ve been preparing for this breath-taking moment for a year straight, what I experienced was a different culture, a different set of values, and a different set of lives. But most importantly, this year’s experiences knocked me out of my comfort zone and triggered me to reflect on my past, how I treated things, and talked with people.

                    "Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma" was my favorite anime, and just like the protagonist Soma Yukihira when he entered the best culinary school in the world, I was confident, proud, and reckless coming into Webb. Unfortunately, life isn’t quite like anime, and I did not dominate every class and competition at Webb like Yukaghir did in his culinary school. When I was in junior high school, I got so used to being under the spotlight – so used to that I thought this was how it’s supposed to be. Therefore, when I knew that the only person running against me was a fat guy, who according to my opinion isn’t that great of a public speaker, I had no expectations that I was going to lose. I was sure I did everything I could to prepare for the election. I wrote my speech, let my friends revise it, fully recited it, and even brought the fancy ringing bowl that Mr. Rios used during Freshman Seminar class in order to “get everyone’s attention.” It was the day of the election. There were 6 people running for class president, much more than the race for VP. They all did good: they probably all had their own styles of speech, and their performance was okay, but for proud Charlie at the time, their speeches were “trite and un-innovative.” When the presidents’ race has ended, and it’s the turn of my opponent and I to run for VP, I was confident that I was going to win it.
